    "At the time, I thought her advice was something really obvious, something that I didn't need to be told."

    "But as the days drift by, the seasons change, and my youth slips through my fingertips, her words hold out as a rare truth in a world full of lies."

    "She's not my therapist anymore, by the way."
    
    "It felt insulting to myself to continue paying for something like therapy, especially when all I got out of it was bullshit anyone could figure out themselves."
    
    "I guess I also saw it as the reaffirmation of my lack of independence, relying on the guidance of others to figure out my own emotions."

    "I feel blinded, not by guilt or regret, but by a thorough lack of purpose."

    "Sometimes it's terrifying, wading into the abyss that is adulthood, all alone in the depths of despair."

    "No...{w=1.0}there are so, so many things that I want, that I never know what I need."

    "I think the only thing that keeps me going these days is knowing that I know nothing."

    "That's not to say I fear Death, however. I know I could come to love her if she held me gently in her arms and told me to forget about all the responsibilities of life."

    "I have always believed that Death's younger sister, Misery, has a tendency to knock on the doors of the weak."

    "She's like...a disease that only violates those who accepts her and let her in with open arms."

    "A master manipulator of the foolish, she is."

    "It's curious; I cannot recall a day where I've noticed a distinct lack of her presence from my life."

    "I'm now so familiar with her embrace that I can no longer distinguish between my muddy feelings of love and loathing for this emptiness that comes from being around her."
