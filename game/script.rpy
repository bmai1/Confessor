    "I suppose I'm lucky that my life isn't bad."

    "Sometimes I think I should try to make my existence a little bit more meaningful."

    "My therapist advised me to stop overthinking about the past or future and simply do what I want to in the present."

    "She jokingly said that even if I became a serial killer, at least I'd have figured out what I was passionate about."

    nvl clear
    
    "At the time, I thought her advice was trite, something that I didn't need to be told."

    "But as the days drift by, the seasons change, and my youth slips through my fingertips, her words hold out as a rare truth in a world full of lies."

    "She's not my therapist anymore, by the way."
    
    "It felt insulting to myself to continue paying for something like therapy, especially when all I got out of it was bullshit anyone could figure out themselves."
    
    "I guess I also saw it as the reaffirmation of my lack of independence, relying on the guidance of others to figure out my own emotions."

    "It's like I'm suffocating."
    
    "I feel blinded, not by guilt or regret, but by a thorough lack of purpose."

    "It's terrifying; wading into the abyss, all alone in the depths of despair."

    "I desperately need to find a reason to keep on living."

    "I'm grasping, reaching, crying out for help."

    "I don't want to die."

    "I don't want to die."

    "I don't want to die, but I don't want anything, really."

    "An acquaintance of mine once asked if I saw myself as similar to Meursault from \"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus, someone drifting through life without a purpose."
    
    "I laughed and immediately denied it."

    "I thought it was normal for people my age to not know what they wanted to do."
    
    "I also had the notion that projecting myself onto a fictional character was somewhat pathetic; a cowardly way to reject one's own truth and just admire the person that one could become."
    
    nvl clear 

    "There's nothing inherently wrong with this escapism, though." 

    "Even if it's frowned upon to wish to be someone you aren't, the majority of people aren't fortunate enough to lack dreams and desires."
    
    "In this case, even if society tends to have negative perceptions of Meursault's character traits such as his apathetic indifference and amorality, I'll admit I'm envious of his psychological freedom."
    
    "It would be nice to not be plagued by modern aspirations for wealth and success or love or whatever."
    
    "I don't need a character to self-insert into to recognize that I also want to be lazy and happy and free from the responsibilities of being a living human being."
    
    nvl clear 

    "But I think what separates me from Meursault is that I'm scared of dying."

    "I think the only thing that keeps me going these days is knowing that I know nothing." 
    
    "It's this awful ignorance of mine that I so despise which keeps me up at night yet gives me the strength to wake up in the morning."

    nvl clear
    
    "This might sound childish, I know, but I'm not yet ready to die."

    "I want to learn as much as I can about the things I enjoy before I grow old and forgetful;"

    "I want to love and hate and cry and laugh;"

    "I want to experience as many different stories as I can before the story of my own life ends."

    "These abstract desire to understand more about the world and myself in the limited time that I have is probably why I can’t focus on anything concrete to advance towards in particular."
    
    nvl clear

    "That's not to say I fear Death, however."
    
    "I know I could come to love her if she held me gently in her arms and told me to forget about all the responsibilities of life."

    "I have always believed that Death's younger sister, Misery, has a tendency to knock on the doors of the weak."

    "She's like...a disease that only violates those who accepts her and let her in with open arms."

    "A master manipulator of the foolish, she is."

    nvl clear

    "It's curious; I cannot recall a day where I've noticed a distinct lack of her presence from my life."

    "I'm now so familiar with her embrace that I can no longer distinguish between my muddy feelings of love and loathing for this emptiness that comes from being around her."
